Hello and welcome to Backcountry Basics! My name is Nathan and I am a full-time university student studying environmental science and am an avid adventurer. I love being outside and enjoying the wonders that are everywhere. I have engaged in many different recreational activities, both commercially and personally, and this website is my attempt to share my experiences and knowledge with the world. Everything is geared towards those who may not be familiar with the outdoor community, but want to become more involved.

During high school, I was a whitewater raft and kayak guide and climbing instructor for four summers. This gave me a glimpse into the world of professional recreation and I absolutely loved it. Since then I have looked for additional opportunities to help others enjoy the natural world in different ways. One of these ways emerged with the idea of starting a blog to introduce more people to the wonders of the natural world through outdoor recreational activities. Since its creation, Backcountry Basics has evolved to incorporate concepts of environmental stewardship and sustainability into each article. In order to preserve the wild places for the future we as a world community need to take action to save the world. It starts with each individual learning to love the world and using that passion to drive change.

As you read through the articles, I hope that you find answers to questions you may have. If you enjoy the content, feel free to make a donation to support future content.
